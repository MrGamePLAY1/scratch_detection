# _Scratch detection steps_
# 1. Import the RAW images
    In this we are identifying the scratch in the image. 
# 2. Convert the RAW images to greyascale
# 3. Convert the images to binary 
# 4. Segment the images into different sections
# 5. Separate the scratches in a folder
# 6. Separate the non-scratched photos in a folder
# 7. Trian the model using the images
